# CMD Emulator

A web-based Windows command prompt emulator (sort of) built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for recreating old console games. This was both an effort to preserve the games ported into it, and simply a fun project to work on!

Ported projects:
- [Hedge Mazes](https://tjvezina.github.io/cmd-emulator/hedge-mazes/)
- [Pokerama](https://tjvezina.github.io/cmd-emulator/pokerama/)
